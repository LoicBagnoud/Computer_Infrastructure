# Computer_Infrastructure

## by Loic Bagnoud

### Task Description 
>
The following repository is a list of 4 problems that try to explore (to be added)
>
Everything is stored in a Jupyter Notebook, using Python code, with several comments describing and highlighting the code we use along the way. The Python interpreter is a programming language that is freely accessible and it being the most common language in Data Analysis, it makes sense that we should use it here.
>
To run the code, you will need a proper integrated development environment (IDE). It is recommended to use Visual Studio as the IDE of choice but any other IDE is capable of running this code. Visual Studio Code can be downloaded [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Python and Packages used
>
To run this project, you'll need Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download the latest version from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
>
Please make sure you follow the instructions outlined there. Additionally, this code uses several packages in order to achieve most of the tasks' objectives. It is expected that those are also properly downloaded and installed on your machine.
>
Instrutions are provided in each package below in order to install them but it is advisable to use Anaconda Distribution as it already contains these packages pre-installed. You can download Anaconda Distribution from here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/success
>
Alternatively, a requirements txt file is also provided with all of the packages that have been used, should you wish to quickly reproduce the github environment by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get exactly the same packages used in the project.

The following list outlines the packages used:

#### Numpy
>
[Numpy](https://numpy.org/) provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of mathematical functions to perform operations on them efficiently. It's the foundation for many scientific and data libraries, including Pandas and scikit-learn. For more information on how to install Numpy, please see the following: https://numpy.org/install/
>
#### Pandas
>
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) is a powerful and user-friendly Python library for working with structured data. It's especially well-suited for datasets, like the Iris dataset, where each column can hold different data types. With its efficient data structures and analysis tools, Pandas makes it easy to explore and manipulate data with both numerical and categorical values. For more information on how to install Pandas, please see the following: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html
>
#### Matplotlib
>
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is an especially useful package for plotting data in formats like line charts, bar graphs, scatter plots, and more. For more information installing matplotlib, please see the following: https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/getting_started/
>
#### Yfinance
>
[Yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) is an open-source Python library used to download financial and market data from Yahoo Finance. It is designed for research and educational purposes and allows users to fetch data such as historical stock prices, financial statements, and corporate actions for analysis in a Python environment.
